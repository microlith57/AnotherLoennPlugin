# Another Lönn Plugin

This plugin adds:
- a **styleground file picker** that works with both unzipped mods and the graphics dump
- a **styleground preview** that sort of works, and lets you see what your parallaxes will look like

Note that this will intentionally stop working for newer Lönn versions than it is updated for, to make sure it doesn't break things.
