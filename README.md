# Another Lönn Plugin

This plugin adds:
- a **styleground file picker** that works with both unzipped mods and the graphics dump
- a **styleground preview** that lets you see what your parallaxes will look like
- keybinds to **snap selected objects to a customisable grid** (<kbd>ctrl + shift + arrow keys</kbd> / <kbd>shift + S</kbd> by default), and to **view that grid** (<kbd>ctrl + shift + G</kbd>)
- keybinds to **pan the view**, defaulting to <kbd>W</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd>
- the ability to **resize rooms below 40×23** when holding a key (<kbd>ctrl</kbd> by default)
- a tool to **move rooms** (even several at a time)
- a tool to **teleport the player** using Everest's DebugRC interface
- a **coordinate viewer** (<kbd>`</kbd> by default)
- the ability to **rotate and flip spikes**
- scripts (for use with [Lönn Scripts](https://gamebanana.com/tools/8050)) to:
  - **copy and paste stylegrounds** using the clipboard, so you can move them between maps, edit them in a text editor, or send them to others;
  - **convert fillers into filler rooms**, for easier editing
  - **fix lightbeams placed in Ahorn**

It also supports the following experimental add-ons, which you should **only put in your mods folder if you're actively using them**, and **could break even unrelated plugins very easily (!)**:
- a **brush mask**, in the edit menu, which lets you make tools only replace either air or ground, rather than both, available [here](https://github.com/microlith57/AnotherLoennPlugin/releases/tag/brushmask-v1.0.0)
- a **colourgrade preview**, available [here](https://github.com/microlith57/AnotherLoennPlugin/releases/tag/colorgrading-v1.0.0)

These features can be configured; see [the wiki](https://github.com/microlith57/AnotherLoennPlugin/wiki) for information.

Note that this will intentionally stop working for newer Lönn versions than it is updated for (currently v0.6.0), to make sure it doesn't break things.
