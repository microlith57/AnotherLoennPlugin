# Another Lönn Plugin

This plugin adds:
- a **styleground file picker** that works with both unzipped mods and the graphics dump
- a **styleground preview** that lets you see what your parallaxes will look like
- the ability to **resize rooms below 40×23** when holding the precision movement key (<kbd>ctrl</kbd> by default)
- a tool to **move rooms** (even several at a time)
- scripts (for use with [Lönn Scripts](https://gamebanana.com/tools/8050)) to **copy and paste stylegrounds** using the clipboard, so you can move them between maps, edit them in a text editor, or send them to others; also one to fix lightbeams placed in Ahorn
- an optional **experimental colourgrade preview**, which you should **only put in your mods folder if you're actively using it** and **could break even unrelated plugins very easily (!)**, available [here](https://github.com/microlith57/AnotherLoennPlugin/releases/tag/colorgrading-v1.0.0)

Note that this will intentionally stop working for newer Lönn versions than it is updated for (currently v0.5.1), to make sure it doesn't break things.
