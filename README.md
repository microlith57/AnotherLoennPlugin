# Another Lönn Plugin

This plugin adds:
- a **styleground file picker** that works with both unzipped mods and the graphics dump
- a **styleground preview** that lets you see what your parallaxes will look like (though it doesn't quite work on some vanilla maps)
- the ability to **resize rooms below 40×23** when holding the precision movement key (<kbd>ctrl</kbd> by default)

Note that this will intentionally stop working for newer Lönn versions than it is updated for, to make sure it doesn't break things.
